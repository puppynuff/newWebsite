<!-- For mobile users.
I don't know how I would make the website compatible for mobile devices, and I don't think I want to spend that much time doing it.
So instead, I am going to make this page for the mobile users :)
Its based off of my carrd, if you want to see whats its supposed to be like when its done.

(I guess if my brother or dad find this, well you know now. At least I don't have to do it directly :])
WHERE I SHINE, NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT LOOKING GOOD.
This will also have much more information.

I am also ok going by: Luna, Stella, or Raven, although most people stick with Shiro (They don't know about the names I was thinking about, and never knew about the last 2 :L)
And yes, Raven is stolen from my best friend Armored Core VI.
All I need to say is big mech.

I am ok with all pronouns, but I prefer She/Her, and I try to avoid he/him.
<a href="https://en.pronouns.page/@Shiro__">Here's my pronouns page.</a>

I'm 16 years old currently, and sadly unemployed.

I like doing some random stuff, mostly surrounding the software engineering area, like AI and backend-web-design. I also like writing, drawing (sometimes), and debating (As long as you are willing to listen.)
For animals, my favorite animal is the artic fox (Just look at it), and my favorite dog breed is huskies or great danes. Cats are cool, but I like how dogs are more affectionate.
Blahaj.
I like talking about politics, just to keep myself informed and try to see other peoples point of view.
I also like singing, but I sing in a monotone voice, and can't really regulate my breath correctly so if you get annoyed, feel free to ask me to stop.

My favorite color is a dark-blue, black, or pink.
My favorite game is A Hat In Time, or Ultrakill, with beamng or celeste being close runner-ups.

I have a wierd obsession with Naval Warfare, Weapon design, and basic design of computers.

I can't really name things I dislike off my mind that well, but here we go.
Front end web design, or I guess just UI / UX in general.
I also don't like loud noises (Makes me feel really bad), crowds, high-pitched or repetative noises, and yelling (I might get loud myself, my mom is half deaf so I got used to it, I dont mean to)

Basic DNI, With some exceptions for jokes.

I'll try to talk to new people, and groups, but I'll probably be quiet most of the time, since I get really uncomfortable.

I get really annoyed when people move my things, since I always lose them afterwards.

Also, at this point I think I need tone-tags, although I'm not so sure. I used to think I was good at telling the differences, until more recently.

I'll probably be quieter when I am talking to new people.

I'm really forgetful on alot of things, like leaving my mic off, and where I place things.

I have two nicknames that people use,
Shit-o,
and cheeto.

I keep forgetting things when making github updates, so it looks like I did alot of updates when they almost all have been one liners,
I forgor to go over my software engineering career!

I started Programming in Scratch, back in 2020 (Someone tried doxxing me, so I deleted it before it could get around.), and later in 2020 moved on to C++
After ~4 months of programming in C++, and having a computer corrupt I created my github account, and created my first discord bot.

Since then I have been working on some projects
An Audio Player
A WIP game engine
Multiple discord bots
An AI text generator API in Kaggle
A music Player
Minecraft Mods / Hacks
Minecraft Computercraft Web Interface
What was meant to be a code editor, but turned more into a code viewer (As in I never got editing working.)
Porting the Shinigami Eyes plugin into Vencord (Cant push to Vencord, since it does kindof work around another plugin by stealing its place...)
And this website! (Old website was also an OS recreation, just was pretty darn bad.)

I also took part of the 2022 Spookcord contest, and might do it again this year, making a discord bot and modifying a library in a week.


I am colorblind, sadly. Sometimes I might mess up colors, but its not too bad for me.

Apparently my favorite music genre is pop, although I listen to a bunch of places.

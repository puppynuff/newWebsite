# This is going to be my new website
## Currently this isn't being hosted, since it's not nearly done

* Why is this a new Repo?
I am making a new repo So that I can reduce all of the extra, uneeded files in there.

* Why are you doing this again?
Fun. Also so that I can make a more functional one, and one that looks better.

## Development
### Variable naming conventions
All variables needs to be snake case, while constants are capitalized.

Class variables should start with a capital letter, and be written camel case.

Avoid using comments, make sure the code is self-readable. Use comments for the more confusing parts.

Never use var, always use let.

File names, and folder names should be snake case.

Try not to nest more than 5 deep.

Unused variables should start with an underscore.

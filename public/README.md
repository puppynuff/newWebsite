# This is the dist directory basically.
Since I am switching to rust, I want to make sure everything works before I publish them.

The website wont get changes for a while

## Whats causing me to make the change?
I dont like javascripts lack of typing, and I just overall like rust more.

Not only that, with my decision to make a fighting game in the website for some reason, I think overall it would be better to switch to rust.

## Why keep the old website?
So that if people wanna visit my website it doesnt randomly stop working

## What will happen to this website after the rust version finishes?
I will add a subdirectory named "old-website" which will link to this one. If anyone wants to continue development of this one, go ahead.

## What is the plan for applications?
My plan hasn't changed for the website.

When I finally finish entirely, I still want to allow people to develop their own applications for my website.

Applications *Still will run off of javascript for user made ones, or you can clone the repo and make rust versions.*

Well, at least thats the hope.

As a small note before we continue:
* I dont know how I will do the applications yet, but the current plan is a database of all of the applications and commands, probably using mongodb
* Rust cannot be built on the website. I will need people to build their rust projects before uploading them.
* The integration is hopefully going to be fully automated. This is a major part of my vision for the website so that is important for me.
* I will write docs for the development *as I go with rust*, instead of ignoring that aspect like I did before, people need to know how to develop it, or no one will want to.
* I cannot limit bad actors, and as such I will warn users about the downloading of applications, and to never run a program downloaded from the website, unless the download is from an official development update.

Thanks for reading the README!

I will leave a second, better one in the rust root. :]

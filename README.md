# My website!
This is my development portfolio.

For updates on the old version, check [the old versions readme](./public/README.md)

## Current goal:
Just migrate the old website over to a rust port.

## Why switch to rust?
I wanted to do this since I want to get used to rust, and plus I want to make a fighting game in which I think will be better on rust.
